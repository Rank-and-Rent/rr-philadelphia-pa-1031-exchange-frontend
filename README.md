This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Content Taxonomy Rationale

This site uses a structured taxonomy designed to support nationwide replacement property identification for 1031 exchange investors. The service taxonomy includes 26 services organized into seven categories: Timelines, Structures, Execution, Tax, Reporting, Property Paths, and Education. These categories reflect the full lifecycle of a 1031 exchange from initial planning through IRS reporting. The location taxonomy includes 23 locations within 30-45 miles of Philadelphia, PA, plus a remote option for nationwide support. This geographic coverage ensures investors can find replacement properties locally while maintaining access to nationwide inventory. The property type taxonomy includes 10 asset classes commonly used in 1031 exchanges, from multifamily and industrial to specialized categories like medical office and student housing. This structure enables investors to identify replacement properties across diverse asset classes while maintaining compliance with IRS like kind requirements. The layout diversity system ensures each service and location page uses a unique layout variant, preventing content duplication and improving user experience through varied presentation styles.
